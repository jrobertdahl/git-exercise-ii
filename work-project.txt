Since I'm pretty satisfied with my description of the project I'm working on for this class I think 
I'll describe something I was working on recently for my job.

So, there's this other company that occasionally takes business from us and I had a bit of time on 
my hands for a bit so I figured I'd try to replicate the core of the technology they offer just to prove 
that they're not so great like everyone thinks they are. To start, I set up an express.js backend 
web application on a local node server. At the root route I put a script that takes a gif of your 
choosing, splices the frames into an array of objects, then loops through that array to rebuild the 
gif from the spliced frames. The cool part is that, within that for loop, you can add text or shape 
data on top of the original frame so that the final gif renders as the original gif *plus* your 
customizated text or animation over top. Additionally, the data determining the text and/or shape data
can be passed into the script through URL parameters, allowing the host to serve up completely 
unique, personalized images for web and email. Who's the hotshot now, MoveableInk?
