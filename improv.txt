I would recommend everyone try improv, even if you go for just one class. The thing 
that makes improv special is the fact that there's no other space in modern adult life 
where you can play so freely. It offers the opportunity to escape the restrictions of 
the various roles you play in life and just exist and explore and create. The exercises you 
go through in class help you develop an awareness of what other people (and you yourself) are 
thinking and feeling.

One objection to trying improv that I've heard from people is that they don't consider themselves 
to be a "funny" person. Fundamentally, improv isn't about being funny, it's about creating something 
with other people. Try it! You won't regret it!
