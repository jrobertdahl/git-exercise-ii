Hello, my name is Jason. I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota and work as a 
Web Developer. I'm a compulsive learner and have picked up many (and even 
kept a few) hobbies and interests over the course of my life. A few 
longstanding interests I've had are music, comedy, and continuing my 
academic studies. To that end, I'm currently playing in a couple bands, 
taking improv classes, and of course, taking this class. Oh, I've also 
recently gotten into fencing. It's understandably not a great spectator 
sport but I would recommend everyone try it! It's very challenging and 
fun!
